<center><h2> Learning Variable Length Markov Models of behaviour</h2></center>

<center> <h2> Abstract </h2> </center>

<p>

In recent years there has been an increased interest in the modelling and 
recognition of human activities involving highly structured and semantically 
rich behaviour such as dance, aerobics, and sign language. A novel approach is
presented for automatically acquiring stochastic models of the high-level 
structure of an activity  without the assumption of any prior 
knowledge. The process involves temporal segmentation into plausible
atomic behaviour components and the use of variable length Markov 
models for the efficient representation of behaviours. Experimental
results are presented which demonstrate the generation of realistic sample
behaviours and evaluate the performance of models for long-term temporal 
prediction.

Figure 1 illustrates stochastic synthesis of sample behaviour using 
the learnt behaviour model. An entirely hypothetical exercise routine sequence 
 has been generated and is used to animate a virtual humanoid using the 
VRML modelling language.

Figure 2 illustrates prediction of future behaviour at a selected time instant.
The learnt behaviour model is initially used in a recognition mode in order 
to locate the appropriate model state given the observed behaviour up to 
that time instant. Having located the current model state, prediction of 
future behaviour is achieved by using the model either as a stochastic 
or a maximum likelihood behaviour generator.
