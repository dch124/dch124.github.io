<center> <h2> Summary </h2> </center>
                                                                                
<p> The focus of this research is to acquire models of interaction  
automatically by observing interactions between humans. The acquired model 
can then be used to enable interaction between a human  and a synthetic 
interactive partner.</p>

<p>In this first experiment, two individuals shaking hands are observed in 
side view.  A large video corpus of typical handshake interactions has 
been used and training data has been extracted automatically by tracking 
individuals and representing them by their profiles. We are considering 
interaction as a joint behaviour between humans, therefore 
interaction is represented as the joint behaviour of object silhouettes.
A large set of prototypes is used to form a representation of the 
joint behaviour space where each of these prototypes represents 
interaction over an extended time period. An individual prototype 
is not generative. It is a compressed representation of interaction 
(encoding temporal history) and in order to be used generatively
for prediction we connect the prototypes into a Markov
chain.</p>
                                                                                
<p>Having acquired the behaviour model, a stochastic algorithm (based on Isard and Blake Condensation algorithm) has been used to propagate multiple 
hypothesis through the behaviour model. The maximum likelihood interaction 
hypothesis provides a natural response to the humans actions. </p>
