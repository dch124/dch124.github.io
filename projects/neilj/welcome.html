<P>
I am currently researching the modelling of `object behaviours' using
detailed, learnt statistical models. The techniques being developed will allow
models of characteristic object behaviours to be learnt from the continuous
observation of long image sequences.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that these models of characteristic behaviours will have a number
of uses, particularly in automated surveillance and event recognition,
allowing the surveillance problem to be approached from a lower level, without
the need for high-level scene/behavioural knowledge. Other possible uses
include the random generation of realistic looking object behaviour for use in
Virtual Reality, and long-term prediction of object behaviours to aid
occlusion reasoning in object tracking.
</P>

We have developed a model of the probability density functions of both the
instantaneous movements and partial trajectories of objects moving within
a scene (the figure above shows a typical pedestrian scene (left), and a set of
pedestrian trajectories within the scene (right)).
The model is learnt in an unsupervised manner by tracking objects
over long image sequences, and is based on a combination of a neural network 
implementing Vector Quantisation and a type of neuron with short-term memory 
capabilities.

<P>
Models of the trajectories of pedestrians have been generated and used to
assess the typicality of new trajectories (allowing the identification of
`incidents of interest' within the scene), predict future object trajectories,
and randomly generate new trajectories. The figure above shows a diagrammatic
representation of a model vector representing a partial pedestrian trajectory
(left), and the set of pedestrian trajectories which it represents (right).
A modified version of the model is currently being developed to learn object
interactions.

My research interests also include unsupervised learning and self-organising
systems.
