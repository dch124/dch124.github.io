<h2>Purpose</h2>

Artificial Intelligence is perhaps one of the most misconceived areas
of Computer Science, largely due to the density of buzz-phrases
associated with the field and the trumped-up claims that the popular
science media make about the potential of AI.<p>

The aim of this 3-day seminar is to cover some of the most popular and
widely-used AI techniques, describe what they do, how they work and
where they can be used. The other main goal is to explain the
jargon and <i>dispell the myths</i>. In this way we hope to be able to
focus on what is practicable and what is infeasible.<p>

For each topic there will be an `expert' from the
<a href="http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/scs/public/home.html">School of
Computer Studies</a> at the
<a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/">University of Leeds</a>
who is either teaching or researching (or
both) in the field, and who will give a talk on the key
issues and in some cases give demonstrations of applications they have
developed. Following this there will be discussions to try to draw out
any potential uses within Psygnosis and to stimulate any ideas people
have. The talks and discussions will be `round the table' and the
atmosphere will be as informal as possible.<p>

To round off the event we have invited Dave Cliff from Sussex
University to give a talk on Artificial Life (a-life) and how it can
be used in the computer entertainment industry. Dave is the UK's
leading researcher into a-life and his talk promises to be really
rather excellent.<p>

Thursday), and will take place on the University of Leeds
Campus. Lunch and coffee breaks will be provided and there is a budget
for some evening entertainment.<p>

<blink>The venue for the first day has been changed. This will now be
in the Merrion Hotel.</blink><p>

<h3>Introduction to AI (<a href="#dch">David Hogg</a>)</h3>

The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has spawned many different
ways for simulating all aspects of human intelligence in machines -
usually general purpose computers. These aspects include perceptual
abilities such as vision and audition, reasoning capabilities, emotional
behaviour, memory, and learning. The talk will briefly introduce the
full range of approaches, including some that are often presented as
radical alternatives to Good-Old-Fashioned-AI (GOFAI for short).<p>

In particular, we will review classical approaches based on various
flavours of logic, constraint satisfaction, pattern recognition, neural
networks, evolutionary approaches, and artificial life. The aim is to
provide an overall context for the presentation of most of these topics
in greater depth during the seminar.<p>

Examples of working systems based on these different approaches to the
construction of intelligent systems will be used by way of illustration
throughout.<p>


<h3>Expert Systems (<a href="#dcr">Dave Ranyard</a>)</h3>

An expert system simulates human reasoning in a specific knowledge domain.
For example, diagnosing a disease or configuring a computer system. In many
situations traditional computing techniques or models are inefficient or
infeasible. We cannot model the human body and the effects of an infective
agent such as the common cold may have on it. However, we can define
heuristics: rules of thumb that provide a core knowledge which can be
applied to a problem domain.<p>
This overview will cover the basic concepts behind expert systems, in
particular:<p>

<ul>
<li>their structure;
<li>their methods of reasoning;
<li>some examples;
<li>a brief look at machine learning.
</ul>

We will look at some ways expert systems may be applicable to the
development of computer games as well as discussing exactly what their
limitations are.<p>


<h3>Genetic Algorithms (<a href="#ajh">Tony Heap</a>)</h3>

Genetic Algorithms are essentially Darwin's theory of Evolution
(survival of the fittest) as applied to computer-aided problem solving.
A `population' of genetically-coded `solutions' are tested on a
`problem' and are each given a score or `fitness'. The solution genes
are then bred using concepts such as mating and mutation to produce a
new and hopefully better population of solutions. Over many iterations
or `genetarions', one or more optimal solutions are eventually found.<p>

In this session we will be discussing:<p>

<ul>
<li>What Genetic Algorithms are
<li>How they work
<li>What you can do with them
<li>What has already been done with them
</ul>

There will also be a discussion on how this concept
extends to `Genetic Programming' - instead of writing a program to
perform a task, it may be possible to let it evolve.<p>


<h3>Natural Language Processing (<a href="#gavin">Gavin Churcher</a>)</h3>

Natural Language Processing is a large field covering many of the
computational aspects of language. Back in the 1950s when the future
potential of computers was beginning to be realised, people believed
that translating between different languages was attainable within a
few years. At the time it seemed that computers could do almost
anything given their speed and large memory (large at the time!).
Initial experiments between Russian and English showed promise. But
then the scientists hit problems. Translation was much more subtle
than they had ever thought. Their mistake was to liken the human mind
to a simple computer. Nowadays, we realise that the problems humans
cope with everyday, from reasoning to having a conversation, are very
difficult for computers to do.<p>

Natural Language Processing covers many aspects of language used by
humans. In my talk I shall be giving an overview of the following
areas:<p>

<ul>
<li>Speech recognition - speech input to a computer
<li>Speech generation - speech output from a computer (from text)
<li>Text generation - generating intelligent text responses 
<li>Semantic representation - internal and external representation of concepts 
<li>Dialogue management - intelligent conversations between agents (human and computer) 
<li>Machine translation - translating between different languages
</ul>


<h3>Fuzzy Logic (<a href="#dcr">Dave Ranyard</a>)</h3>

Fuzzy sets are a relatively new method of handling uncertain data and
knowledge. They extend the concept of traditional sets to include the notion
of partial membership to a set. For example, if we define a set of fast-cars
as cars which go at least 150mph, fuzzy sets allows us to define a partial
membership to this set so that a car which goes 140mph can be classed as
"quite fast". Fuzzy logic operators have been defined on top of fuzzy set
theory which correspond to traditional Boolean logic operators. Combining
these techniques provides a simple method of dealing with uncertainty by
linking them to linguistic concepts such as: tall, long, old and so on. By
doing this fuzzy approaches are deemed to emulate the human thought process
more closely than more traditional, rigid computational processes.
This discussion of fuzzy sets will provide an overview of the concepts of
fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic and how they can be used. They will be put into
context by comparing them briefly with other uncertainty management
techniques such as probabilities and Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence.
Some applications will be discussed as well as the limitations and
criticisms of the fuzzy approach.<p>


<h3>Neural Nets (<a href="#neilj">Neil Johnson</a>)</h3>

Although the development of the digital computer has seen rapid increases
in computing power, there are many tasks routinely performed by humans (such
as pattern recognition) which have proved extremely difficult and
computationally expensive to achieve. Research into the structure and
dynamics of the human brain suggests that the basis of biological
computation is a small number of serial processing steps within a huge,
massively interconnected, network of relatively simple processing units.<p>

Research into (Artificial) Neural Networks has been motivated by the
recognition of this different approach to computation, resulting in the
development of many different artificial neural structures, all based
around the idea of large interconnected networks of relatively simple
processing units where information is stored by virtue of the strengths
of the interconnections.<p>

This tutorial will cover the basic ideas behind neural networks,
highlighting the types of tasks for which they can be used, the benefits
of the neural network approach, and some of the problems involved in
their use. Finally, as an example, some current research with possible
applications in the development of computer games will be discussed and
demonstrated.<p>


<h3>Hidden Markov Models (<a href="#roger">Roger Boyle</a>)</h3>

Hidden Markov Models are a mechanism for determining the behaviour of
sequential systems by observing them through a (probably noisy) filter.<p>

In this tutorial, we will explore the need for hidden models of sequential
real world events, and concentrate on the Markov approach.  The theory
will be introduced via a simple example, and then delivered in detail.  A
`real world' application will then be explained that generalises the
approach to cope with some of its shortcomings.<p>

[God willing] a software demonstration will also be given.<p>

Suitable references and supporting documentation will be available.<p>


<h3>Artificial Life in Entertainment Software (<a href="#davec">Dave Cliff</a>)</h3>

Artificial Life involves a variety of biologically inspired computing
techniques which ease the development of complex adaptive
systems. Typically, the complexity in the system is an "emergent
phenomena", resulting from interactions between a number of
comparatively simple components. In this talk I'll give a brief
overview of the major artificial life (a-life) techniques,
concentrating on the integration of these techniques into autonomous
software agents which can perceive and act within virtual
environments, possibly interacting with other synthetic agents or with
human users. Following this, I'll discuss the current market
penetration of a-life technologies in the computer games industry, and
sketch some potential future applications.<p>
