<h2>Overview</h2>

The Leeds Hand Tracker was developed by <a href="/~ajh">Tony
Heap</a>. An unmarked human hand can be tracked from a single colour
video camera connected to a suitable workstation. An uncluttered
background is not necessary and the tracker can be trained
specifically to one hand colour to improve performance. The current
version of the tracker is limited to being able to track a hand held
palm out with all fingers showing. We are currently developing a more
sophisticated version in which full unrestricted movement is possible.
<p>

At the heart of the system is a deformable outline model of the hand,
which has been constructed from a number of examples of hands in
different positions. The hand is tracked from frame to frame using a
non-trivial edge detection technique to drive the model towards the
hand in the image. Full technical details can be found in
<a href="ftp://ftp.cam-orl.co.uk/pub/docs/ORL/tr.95.1.ps.Z">Olivetti
Research Limited Tech Report 95.1</a>. Here's a snapshot of the
tracker in action...<p>

<h2>Try it out...</h2>

If you have a Silicon Graphics Indy(TM) running Irix 5.3 or later, you
can try the hand tracker out for yourself.
<p>

<h2>Downloading</h2>

You can download <a href="Code/HandTrackerV2.1.tar.Z">
<tt>HandTrackerV2.1.tar.Z</tt></a> onto your host machine (350Kb).
To unarchive it, type:<p>

<pre>
uncompress HandTrackerV2.1.tar.Z
tar -xf HandTrackerV2.1.tar
</pre>

This generates the <tt>handtracker</tt> directory with everything you
need in it.

<h2>Instructions for use</h2>

Before running the demo, you should check that the IndyCam is set up
properly. Type <tt>vcp</tt>
to load the video control panel, and check that the default input is
`IndyCam' and not `Analog Source'. Select `Live Video Input' from the
`Utilities' menu to check that a signal is coming through. Quit the
live video input before running the tracker demo.

To run the tracker demo, type this:

<pre>
cd handtracker/demo
tracker
</pre>

This should bring up a window with the view from the IndyCam in it
(reversed so it acts like a mirror). There is a hand template in the
middle of the view. If you move your right hand up to the template it
should `lock on' to your hand and follow it around from there. The
tracker can only track your hand so long as the palm and all fingers
are showing. If it thinks it has lost your hand it resets to the
central position. If it's stuck on the wrong part of your hand, remove
your hand from view and it will reset.

<h2>Filename Problems</h2>

If you get an error like <tt>load_linear_mean: Can't open
   "../models/hand-lin.mean" for reading</tt>, then the tracker
can't find the hand model - you need to use the <tt>-m</tt>
   switch to tell it where the model files (<tt>hand-lin.*</tt>) are, eg.

<pre>
tracker -m ./hand-lin L
</pre>

The <tt>L</tt> is necessary, but don't worry about its meaning!

<a name="lighting"><h2>Lighting conditions</h2></a>

The tracker's performance can be improved by adjusting the colour
filtering to suit your particular lighting conditions. To check the
colour filtering, run the tracker in training mode:

<pre>
tracker -train
</pre>

Along with the normal view there will be a smaller filter window,
showing the image after colour filtering. It should look something
like this:<p>

<center>
<img src="Images/goodfilter.gif">
</center>
<p>

There is good definition of the hand and it should track well. If it
looks like either of these:<p>

<center>
<img src="Images/toowhitefilter.gif">
<img src="Images/toodarkfilter.gif">
</center>
<p>

then it might be worth altering the colour filtering. The tracker has
an auto-train facility for this. Hold your hand up to the IndyCam so
that the whole of the small square is filled with hand-coloured
pixels. Then (with your other hand) click the left mouse button. The
pixels are sampled and a colour histogram is built. The new filter is
then used in the filter window. You can take more samples by repeating
this process. To clear the histogram and start again, click the middle
button. When (if) you're happy, click the right mouse button to save
the histogram (the filename used is <tt>tracker.hist</tt>).<p>

To use your trained colour filter, type:

<pre>
tracker -hist &lthistogram filename&gt
</pre>

Performance of the auto-trainer is sometimes marred by poor lighting
or by the relatively low quality
of the IndyCam. If you can't get good results by auto-training, you
can manually alter the red/green/blue components of the colour filter
to make it respond bettor to your skin tones. Try:

<pre>
tracker -train -f &ltr&gt &ltg&gt &ltb&gt
</pre>

Where R, G and B are the three colour
filter values (used additively, so the filtered greyscale value for a
pixel with colour components r, g and b is r*R + g*G + b*B).
The defaults are 4.0, -2.0 and -2.0 respectively which
has the effect of highlighting red but damping white.<p>

If you're still having problems there are two other measures. Firstly,
find a source of ambient light (such as an anglepoise lamp) and
position it to illuminate your hand. Secondly, go to a hardware store
and buy some bright yellow rubber gloves. Then use the auto-trainer to
respond to them. If this doesn't work, I don't know what will!


<h2>Command line options</h2>

When you run the tracker you can alter its behaviour with one or more
command line switches:<p>

<tt>-m &ltmodel base filename&gt &ltmodel type L/P/H&gt</tt> is to specify
the hand model filename. The only model available at the moment is
<tt>hand-lin</tt> so there ain't much choice, but you can include the
full or relative pathname if yours is different to
<tt>../models/hand-lin</tt>.
<p>

<tt>-v &ltnumber of variation modes&gt</tt> specifies the number of
degrees of freedom in the variation of the mand model. The default is
4. Decrease to 3, 2, 1 or 0 for slight speed increase coupled with
less robustness.
<p>

<tt>-i &ltnumber of iterations&gt</tt> is the number of tracking
iterations per frame. There is a speed/performance tradeoff. Default
is 4.
<p>

<tt>-step &ltvalue&gt</tt> alters the tracker sensitivity ie. how far
the model can move per iteration. There is a tradeoff between speed
and stability. Default is 1.0.
<p>

<tt>-rotate <angle in degrees></tt> alters the initial orientation of
the hand template. -90 degrees is upright.
<p>

<tt>-lefthand</tt> reverses the hand template for left handed use.
<p>

<tt>-overhead</tt> configures the tracker for use with an overhead
camera pointing down onto a desktop.
<p>

<tt>-mouse</tt> puts the tracker in mouse pointer control mode. See <a
href="#mouse">below</a> for details.
<p>

<tt>-outputpos</tt> outputs hand position info to stdout so you can
pipe it into your own applications. See <a href="#apps">below</a> for more
details.
<p>

<tt>-train</tt> runs the tracker in `lighting condition training' mode.
See <a href="#lighting">`lighting conditions'</a> below for details.
<p>

<tt>-hist &ltfilename&gt</tt> specifies the colour histogram filename.
See <a href="#lighting">`lighting conditions'</a> below for details.
<p>

<tt>-f &ltred filter value&gt &ltgreen filter&gt &ltblue filter&gt</tt>
sets the colour filter values to suit your lighting conditions.
See <a href="#lighting">`lighting conditions'</a> below for details.
Defaults are 4.0, -2.0, -2.0.
<p>

<tt>-w &ltsize&gt</tt> specifies the relative window size. Default is
1, other valid options are 2 and 0.5. Using a smaller window speeds up
the tracker a bit since there are less pixels to write to the
screen. Using a larger windows slows it down a lot.
<p>

<tt>-d &ltinterval&gt</tt> dictates how frequently the IndyCam view is
echoed to screen. Default is 1; increasing to 2 displays every other
frame, 3 does every 3rd frame etc. This is purely to speed the tracker
up by way of fewer screen-writes.
<p>

<tt>-r</tt> periodically outputs the frame rate.
<p>

<tt>-s</tt> outputs the number of model points which have `found an
edge' in each frame.
<p>


<tt>-thicklines</tt> draws the hand outline thicker so it's more
visible.
<p>

<tt>-noannotate</tt> suppresses the sizing circle and angle line which
usually accompany the hand outline.
<p>


<a name="mouse">
<h2>Using the hand tracker to control the mouse pointer</h2>
</a>

Yes! You can now control the mouse pointer without even touching the
mouse! Try:

<pre>
tracker -mouse
</pre>

The pointer moves with the position of your hand. You
perform mouse button clicks by moving your thumb.

<a name="apps">
<h2>Using the hand tracker to control your own applications</h2>
</a>

You can use the hand tracker to control your own applications if you
want. There are two ways to do this. The simplest is to use the
tracker in output mode by typing:<p>

<pre>
tracker -outputpos
</pre>

The tracker spurts position info to <tt>stdout</tt> which can be piped
into you application or whatever. The format of the output is as
follows:<p>

<pre>
X = &ltx coordinate of centre of hand&gt
Y = &lty coordinate of centre of hand&gt
SIZE = &ltapproximate width of hand in pixels, divided by two&gt
ANGLE = &ltangle of hand to horizontal in degrees (upright is -90 deg)&gt
DEFORM = &ltlist of deformation parameters from which hand shape can be
	  determined (default is 4 params, but can be overridden by -v
	  switch)&gt
THUMB_IN = &lt0 if the thumb is out, 1 if the thumb is in&gt
</pre>

I plan to include other parameters in a future version, such as the
position of the thumb (`in' or `out'), so allow for unrecognized
parameters in any code you write. Also, let me know if you have any
special requests.<p>

A more sophisticated way to link the hand tracker to your own
applications has been developed by  <a
href="http://http2.brunel.ac.uk:8080/~empgrrb/">Richard Bowden</a>; it's geared
primarily towards (but not limited to) Inventor(TM)
applications. Click <a href="/~richard/handtrackertop.html">here</a>
