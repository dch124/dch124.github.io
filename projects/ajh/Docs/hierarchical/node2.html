<P>
A PDM is built purely from the statistical analysis of a number of
examples of the object to be modelled&nbsp;[<A HREF="node6.html#cootes95">3</A>]. Given a
collection of training images of an object, the Cartesian
coordinates of <I>N</I> strategically-chosen landmark points are recorded
for each image. Training example <I>e</I> is represented by a vector
 <IMG WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline451" SRC="img3.gif"  >  (for a 2D model).
<P>
The examples are aligned (translated, rotated and scaled) using a
weighted least squares algorithm, and the mean shape
 <IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=10 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline453" SRC="img4.gif"  > 
is calculated by finding the mean position of each landmark
point. The modes of variation are found using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) on the deviations of examples from the mean,
and are represented by <I>N</I> orthonormal `variation vectors'  <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline457" SRC="img5.gif"  > .  
An object shape  <IMG WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=7 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline459" SRC="img6.gif"  > 
is generated by adding linear combinations of the <I>t</I> most significant
variation vectors to the mean shape:

where  <IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline463" SRC="img8.gif"  >  is the weight for the  <IMG WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline465" SRC="img9.gif"  >  variation
vector.
Generally, most important deformation is captured by only a few
variation vectors; the rest represent noise in the training data.
By choosing  <IMG WIDTH=53 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline467" SRC="img10.gif"  > , we extract only the important deformations,
discarding noise, and thus compactly capture object shape
and variation.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">Limitations of the Linear PDM</A></H2>
<P>
A good deformable model should be <em>accurate</em>,
<em>specific</em> and <em>compact</em>. An accurate model includes all
valid shapes. A specific model excludes all invalid shapes. A compact
model uses the smallest number of parameters possible to describe a
shape (ie. its 
dimensionality approaches the
natural deformational dimensionality of the object being modelled).
<P>
Model shape can be described in terms position within an
<I>n</I>-dimensional <em>shape space</em>. In the case of a PDM the dimensions are
the <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> coordinates of every landmark point.
Within the shape space there is generally a continuous region which
corresponds to
<em>valid</em> shapes; in this paper we refer to this as the
valid shape region, or VSR.
<P>
The Linear PDM assumes that the set of all valid shapes forms a
Gaussian distribution about some mean point in the shape space,
representing the VSR as being bounded by a hyperellipsoid.
In some cases, especially when model landmarks have been
chosen strategically, this approximation is sufficient to
produce a satisfactory model which is both compact and
specific. However, in many real objects, non-linear deformations (such as
bending or pivoting) are a natural occurrence. The Linear PDM is forced to
model non-linear deformations by the combination of two or more linear
deformations. Such models are not compact because the dimensionality is
increased, and not specific because invalid shapes can be produced via
an invalid
combination of linear deformations (see Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#linearlamp">4</A>
for examples).
<P>
There are various techniques one can use to transform the shape space in
such a way as to linearise the VSR&nbsp;[<A HREF="node6.html#sozou94">9</A>, <A HREF="node6.html#sozou95">10</A>, <A HREF="node6.html#heap95b">6</A>].
In these approaches there is always a notion of a base shape (usually
the mean shape) and a fixed number of independent modes of variation,
valid over a fixed, continuous range.
However, in some cases the VSR is <em>not</em> linearisable in a simple
manner. A VSR can in theory have an arbitrary topology and its
dimensionality can vary over the shape space. This is perhaps more
common than one might think; for example, in building a model of three
hand gestures and the transitions amongst them, the VSR
takes the form of a hollow triangle.
A method is required for representing <em>any</em> possible VSR.
