Despite considerable research and significant progress, current object recognition and tracking software is unreliable under real-world operating conditions. Object trackers have particular difficulty with complex scenes where multiple moving objects are in close proximity or occlude each other. Object recognition algorithms are also inaccurate, especially where objects are seen from different angles or are occluded. 
Our system takes the imperfect output produced by object tracking and classification software and refines it based on principles of logical consistency and spatio-temporal continuity. The result is a significant improvement in the accuracy of automatic labelling of objects in video images of a dynamic scene. 

<br><br>Vision researchers have proposed a variety of techniques for resolving indeterminacies caused by close proximity and occlusion among objects. Several approaches involve some kind of reasoning about the continuity of objects. The system developed at Leeds takes account of spatio-temporal continuity in a very general way, based on qualitative spatial and temporal relationships and logical modelling of continuity constraints. Our system performs long-term reasoning about object-blob associations over extended sequences of frames. By maintaining spatio-temporal consistency over sequences, many local imperfections and ambiguities in the low-level data are eliminated.
