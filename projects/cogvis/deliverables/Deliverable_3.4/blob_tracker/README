Leeds Car/Blob Tracker Distribution 1.1
---------------------------------------
(c) Derek Magee, University of Leeds

Leeds Vision Group give permission for this code to be copied, modified
and distributed within the University of Leeds and the CogVis consortium 
subject to the following conditions:-

- The code is not to be used for commercial gain.
- The code and use thereof will be attributed to the authors where
  appropriate (including demonstrations which rely on it's use).
- All modified, distributions of the source files will retain headers.

System Requirements
-------------------
Will run on most Linux systems. Test systems inc:

RedHat 7.1/7.2/7.3
Intel PIII (various speeds)
NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards 

Libraries
_________

Supplied libraries required are:

libBGD.a
libmpeg3.a 
libRTImage.a
libglow.a
libquicktime.a
libRTImageDisplay.a

Other (standard libraries) required are:

-lpng -lz -lglib -ldl -lglut -lGLU -lGL -lX11 -lm -lpthread

These should be installed as standard on your linux distribution. 
Note: Recent versions of RedHat (and other distributions) do not install the
GLUT library by default. You must install this manually from rpms or source
(usualy provided with the distribution). 

FIRST: To make the supplied libraries type:

make clean
make

(NOTE: libmpeg3/libglow/libquicktime are configured for my machine, to 
re-configure enter the appropriate directory and follow the instructions)

NEXT: To make tracker type:

make tracker

Running
-------

./drm_cartrack/track_cars <mpeg file> (<groundplane model>)

N.B. Output is written to a file (/tmp/track_cars.out by default) 

Building Groundplane Models
---------------------------
Groundplane models are built from the output of the tracker (or similarly
formatted file). These can improve the initialisation of the tracker to a 
degree, although the tracker can work without such a model. 

To make the executable enter the groundplane_model directory and type 'make'.
To build the model use:

Usage ./cluster_road <data file> <projective angle> <x offset> <outfile>

where:

<data file> : output file of tracker
<projective angle> : groundplane projection angle (see GP_CALIBRATION_ANGLE in
                     drm_cartrack/track_cars_defs.h)
<x offset> : Offset of x co-ordinates from centre (half image width)
<outfile> : Output model file

Format of the model file is:

ROADMODEL DATA FILE    // File ID
COV 22213.732077 29097.706183 29097.706183 73164.169881 // Global Covariance
NO_PROTS 150  // No of prototypes

// Then the prototype data .....

<x gp pos> <y gp pos> <normalised direc x> <normalsed direc y> <speed> <local badwidth factor of cov>
