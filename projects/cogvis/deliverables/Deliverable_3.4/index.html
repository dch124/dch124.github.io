<b>This deliverable is composed of three software packages to support learning and applying visual behaviour models and the presentations' slides given on the 03/06/2003.<BR>
<BR>
The first package is a generalisation of the variable length Markov model and the hidden Markov model, creating a so called <i>variable length hidden Markov model</i>. This is based on recent work applied to speech and is a novel application within computer vision. The model is hierarchical, allowing behaviour over different time scales to be represented.<BR>
<BR>
The second and third packages are trackers that are intended to be used to provide input to the behaviour learning component from realistic video sequences. The first is a generic tracker that although developed for traffic scenes may be applied elsewhere. This is based on learnt foreground and background models and extends the state of the art for such trackers. The second is a reimplementation of the Manchester face tracker, with some novel features, and is intended to provide the consortium with a state of the art tool supporting facial behaviour analysis.<BR>
<BR>
Both the blob tracker and face tracker have already been made available to other Cogvis partners.<BR>
