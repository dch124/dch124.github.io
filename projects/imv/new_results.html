<h2><a name="data_format"> About the files </a></h2>

The images are numbered using the Leeds frame numbering. (This was
so that I could process the first 100 frames which would otherwise
have a negative frame number !). To convert to Reading frame numbering simply subtract 176.
<br>

For each input image processed I have generated 2 gzip'ed files ...
<ol>
<li><h3>The camera view image</h3> e.g. <font face="Courier">02560.pgm.gz</font>  <br>
<img align=center alt="Image 02560" src="example_view.gif" width=300>
<p>
This file is a (compressed) pgm image of the tracked objects 
(people and cars)
rendered onto the camera view plane. The image illustrates the relative depths used by the system for occlusion handling. Each object is rendered by a greylevel between 0 and 255. For each tracked person there
is a reference number or label. The greylevel used to render a person is related to the reference number using ... 
<blockquote>
greylevel = 128 + (ref_no & 127) 
</blockquote>
Hence people will appear lighter than cars (with a greylevel &gt; 127).
To view an image use <br> 'gunzip -c 00001.pgm.gz | xv -gamma 5 -'
<p>
<li><h3>The ascii data file</h3>
e.g. <font face="Courier">02560.dat.gz</font><br>
<A HREF="example_data.htm"> (click here to see example file contents)</A> <br>
This file contains data for each tracked person in the image. Specifically, the file consists of a set of tags ...<br>
<ul>
<li> label n <br> 
- the reference number for this tracked person
<li> wp_pos (x<sub>w</sub>,y<sub>w</sub>) <br>
- the world plane 
coordinates of the person's feet
<LI><img alt="new!" src="../new.gif"> wp_cov xx xy yy <br>
- the covariance matrix elements of the estimated world plane
coordinates
<li> image_origin (x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>) <br>
- the image plane
coordinates of the silhouette origin
<li> image_width w
<li> image_height h
<li> control_points (x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>) (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) ... (x<sub>39</sub>,y<sub>39</sub>) <br>
- the image plane coordinates of the spline control points that represent the silhouette shape
</ul>

</ol>

<h2><a name="mpegs"> MPEG visualisations</a></h2> I have also
generated several MPEG files visualising the tracking results. The
sequences are quite long and may be slow to play.  There are also some
quite boring sections in which little happens.  Hence, I have extended
the standard unix "mpeg_play" program to allow random access to image
frames. This allows you to play fast or jump to an interesting part of
the sequence. <A HREF="../ra_player/mpeg_player.html"> Click here for
more details. </A> Download the MPEG files and view with the 
extended player.

occlusions.
