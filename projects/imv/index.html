<h1>

An Integrated Traffic and Pedestrian Vision System</h1></center>



<hr>

<p>This page describes the Integrated Traffic and Pedestrian Vision System

developed by a collaboration between the vision groups at <a href="../welcome.html">Leeds</a>

and <a href="http://www.cvg.cs.reading.ac.uk/">Reading</a> Universities

as part of the EPSRC's IMV program (EPSRC Grant GR/K46620).

<p>The project combines two model-based tracking systems:

<ul>

<li>

Using active shape models to track non-rigid objects, in this case people.

(Leeds)</li>



<li>

Using geometric 3D models to track rigid objects: in this case cars. (Reading)</li>

</ul>

Mutual occlusion between vehicles and people is handled by passing 2D 'occlusion

masks' between the two systems.

<p>Two complementary approaches for analysing the interactions between

people and vehicles were explored:

<ul>

<li>

At Leeds we have shown how to detect atypical events using features of

the spatio-temporal trajectories of people in relation to vehicles. To

do this, the trajectories of people are compared with a probabilistic model

for the distribution of these features obtained by observing large numbers

of typical interactions.</li>



<li>

At Reading they have developed a system to produce natural language descriptions

of object interactions using Bayesian belief nets.</li>

</ul>

Heres what Don Braggins had to say about this project in the Oct 97 issue

of Image Processing Europe:

<blockquote>Last Year I reviewed Daniel Crevier's book 'AI - the tumultuous

history of the search for artificial intelligence' in which he relates

how in 1966 Marvin Minsky set a first year undergraduate, Gerald Sussman,

the task of connecting a television camera to a computer and getting the

machine to describe what it saw. He did not succeed, but a joint project

between Prof. David Hogg's group at Leeds University and Dr Tieniu Tan's

at Reading (taking over the reins from the late Geoff Sullivan) comes close

to achieving that goal. They have been able to automatically annotate image

sequences to say, for instance, that 'Pedestrian <i>n</i> is now walking

slowly in front of parked vehicle <i>m</i>' where <i>n</i> and <i>m</i>

are simply the sequential numbers relating to appearance in the scene.

Based on work David Hogg's group has done in finding algorithms to identify

suspicious behaviour in car parks, it should not be long before the annotation

can be extended to say 'Pedestrian <i>n</i> looks about to nick something

out of vehicle <i>m</i> better have a human look at the image on the monitor'.</blockquote>

The work also featured on BBC Look North (30/3/98), Radio 5 Live (30/3/98),

Daily Telegraph</a> (2/4/98), OCE magazine. According to BBC breakfast

(23/4/98) we're a 'civil liberties nightmare.'
