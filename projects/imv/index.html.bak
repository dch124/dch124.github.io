This page describe the Integrated Traffic and Pedestrian
Model-Bassed Vision System, being developed at 
Computer Vision Groups at 
<a href="http://dream1.leeds.ac.uk/~vislib/welcome.html">Leeds</a> and 
<a href="http://holly.rdg.ac.uk/">Reading</a> Universities
as part of the EPSRC's IMV program (EPSRC Grant GR/K46620).
</P>

<p>
The project combines two model bassed tracking systems:
<OL>
<LI>
Using active shape models to track non-rigid objects, in this
case people. (Leeds)
<LI>Using geometric 3D models to track rigid
objects: cars. (Reading)
</ol>
 These systems have been integrated to handle mutual occlusion.
Recient work has focused on analysing the behaviour of people
and annotating the interactions:
<ul>
<li>At Leeds we have developed a system
which uses landmark point on trajectories to build a geometric representaion
of a the path a person takes through a scene and also
their interactions with vehicles. This representation allows us to 
used supervised learning techniques to assues the likelyhood of a
particular trajectory.
<li>Reading has developed a system to produce natural language 
descriptions of object interactions using basian belief nets.
</ul>

Heres what Don Braggins had to say about this project in the Oct 97
issue of Image Processing Europe:
<blockquote>
Last Year I reviewd Daniel Crevier's book 'AI - the tumultuous history 
of the search for artificial intelligence' in which he relates how
in 1966 Marvin Minsky set a first year undergraduate, Gerald Sussman, the
task of connecting a television camera to a computer and getting the
machine to describe what it saw. He did not succeed, but a joint project between 
Prof. David Hogg's group at Leeds University and Dr Tieniu Tan's at Reading
(taking over the reins from the late Geoff Sullivan) comes close to achieving 
that goal. They have been able to automatically annotate image sequences to
say, for instance, that 'Predestrian <em>n</em> is now walking slowly
in front of parked vehicle <em>m</em>' where <em>n</em> and <em>m</em>
are simply the sequential numbers relating to appearance in the scene.
Based on work in which David Hogg's group has done in finding algorithms to
identify suspicious behaviour in car parks, it should not be long before 
the annotation can be extended to say 'Predestrian <em>n</em> looks
about to nick something out of vehicle <em>m</em> better have a human 
look at the image on the monitor'.
