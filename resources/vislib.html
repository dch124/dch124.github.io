<P>This page describes the software resources that are contained in the
VISLIB user space. Other school resources are available in xtools. PS.
I'm still working on this... </P>

<HR width="100%"></H2>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>VISLIB is a suite of resources for use by the Leeds University Vision
Group members. It lives in the user space <TT>~vislib</TT> on both the
DCRE and SGI networks. It contains applications, tools, libraries, source
code, information and data which is (or may one day be, or may once have
been) of use to Vision Group members. VISLIB is maintained collectively
by group members. </P>

<H2>Organization</H2>

<P>VISLIB has user space on both DCRE and the SGI network, both as <TT>~vislib</TT>.
The DCRE account currently has 130Mb and the SGI account has 40Mb. The
structure of both accounts is very similar (and in many places identical
- by use of symbolic links); however, the DCRE account is geared towards
IRIX 5.3/IRIX 6 and the SGI account is geared towards IRIX 4.</P>

<P>Both accounts has the following structure:</P>

<PRE>~vislib ----- src
          |-- bin
          |-- lib
          |-- include
          |-- tmp
          |-- demos
          |-- data
          |-- docs
          |-- man
          --- WWW
</PRE>

<P>The directories shown above have the following uses:</P>

<P><B><TT>src</TT></B> is for source code (and associated materials) of
applications, tools and libraries. There is a separate subdirectory for
each app/tool/lib, and the general idea is that each app/tool/lib should
`live' here, and be compiled here, and the <TT>bin</TT>, <TT>lib</TT> and
<TT>include</TT> directories should just contain symbolic links to the
relevant executables/libraries/header files.</P>

<P><B><TT>bin</TT></B> is for executables (IRIX 5/6 for DCRE, IRIX 4 for
SGI). These either exist directly in <TT>bin</TT> or, more commonly, as
symbolic links to files under <TT>src</TT>. <TT>bin</TT> is unstructured
(no, or very few subdirectories) so that users can easily access executables
simply by putting <TT>~vislib/bin</TT> in their search path. This has the
side effect of making the directory very crowded and unreadable. It should,
however, be possible to work out what a particular executable is by looking
as what its symbolic link is (using <TT>ls -l</TT>). For example if I notice
that mr_<TT>slicer</TT> is a link to <TT>../src/mrutils/process_utils/slicer</TT>,
I know that it must be some kind of magnetic resonance image utility.</P>

<P><B><TT>lib</TT></B> is for stand alone (<TT>.a</TT>) and shared (<TT>.so</TT>)
libraries. Again these are mostly symbilic links to the physical files
under the <TT>src</TT> directory. Libraries are also generally OS specific,
so expect differences between the DCRE and SGI versions of this directory.</P>

<P><B><TT>include</TT></B> is for header (<TT>.h</TT>) files. Mostly symbolic
links again.</P>

<P><B><TT>tmp</TT></B> is a temporary directory for newly-installed stuff.
The idea is that if you want to download something and try it out you can
put it in here. When you've evaluated whether it's any use or not you can
either delete it or install it properly under <TT>src</TT>, document it
(add it to the list on this page, and make <TT>README</TT> files), and
tell everyone that it's available and how useful it is.</P>

<P><B><TT>archive</TT></B> is for old stuff that I'm not sure what it's
for or if anyone uses it.</P>

<P><B><TT>demos</TT></B> contains demos of the work of Vision Group members.
This is to allow people's work to be shown to visitors even if they're
not there.</P>

<P><B><TT>data</TT></B> is for vision-related data. Qualifying categories
are images, volumetric data, video sequences, etc etc. Most data will be
specific to one person and as such should be kept in their own user space.
Stuff in here is either shared data or data that's too big for people's
own user space.</P>

<P><B><TT>docs</TT></B> is for useful documents or information. This is
<I>not</I> for documentation of the apps/libs kept in VISLIB - this should
be kept with the source code, as this is where users would naturally look
for it. In fact, I don't think there will be much stuff in here at all,
since most stuff will be in <TT>WWW</TT>.</P>

<P><B><TT>man</TT></B> is for man pages. Again, not many of these.</P>

<P><B><TT>WWW</TT></B> is for any web stuff (including this page, and the
Vision Group home page).</P>

<P>Every directory should have a <TT>README</TT> or <TT>CONTENTS</TT> file
included which gives a short description of what the directory contains,
and more importantly, <I>who owns or maintains it</I>. This is essential
in order to keep VISLIB in some kind of order, as the biggest problem with
tidying it up has definitely been finding out who uses what.</P>

<H2>Using VISLIB Utilities</H2>

<P>To give yourself easier access to the utils in VISLIB, you can set up
your environment in certain ways. </P>

<UL>
<LI>Set your PATH variable to include ~vislib/bin. Do this using <TT>setenv
PATH ~vislib/bin:$PATH</TT> Add the above line to your <TT>.cshrc</TT>
file for a more permanent change. </LI>

<LI>Include ~vislib/man in your search for man pages. Don't know how to
do this - if anyone else does, please fill in here. </LI>
</UL>

<H2>Contents</H2>

<P>There now follows a list of what's currently installed/available in
VISLIB, along with a few brief descriptions here and there. </P>

<H3>Info/Docs</H3>

<H4>Rosenfeld's Computer Vision Bibliographies</H4>

<P><TT>docs/Rosenfeld/*</TT></P>

<P>These are comprehensive bibliographies of computer vision papers published
year by year. They're also available on the Web.</P>

<H3>Applications</H3>

<H4>Image/Movie Format Conversion Utilities</H4>

<P><TT>bin/{*2*, *to*}</TT></P>

<P>Convert various image and movie formats. There are loads more of these
in <TT>~xtools/pbmplus</TT>.</P>

<H4>MRI Viewer and Utilities</H4>

<P><TT>bin/mr_*</TT></P>

<P>Used to view (<TT>mr_viewer</TT>) and manipulate (the others) MR volume
images held in <TT>data/mrimages</TT>. The source for the viewer is closely
guarded by Andy Bulpitt. The source for the utils is in <TT>src/mrutils/view_utils</TT>.</P>

<H3>Libraries</H3>

<H4>Lapack and Lapack++ matrix/linear algebra libraries</H4>

<P><TT>lib/{liblapack.a, liblapack++.a, libblas++.a}, include/lapack++.h</TT></P>

<P>Very comprehensive matrix classes, using the BLAS fast algebra routines.
If you read the user manual, it sounds really impressive. If you want to
use it, ask Tony Heap for help - he has a little experience in it. Try
reading the <A HREF="http://unix.hensa.ac.uk/netlib/c++/lapack++/index.html">user
manual</A>.</P>

There is a simple test program in ~vislib/src/lapack++/vislib_tests which
shows you how to use lapack++. The associated makefile shows how to compile.

<H4>Octave</H4>

<P><TT>lib/{liboctave.a, libcruft.a}, include/octave/*.h</TT></P>

<P>Some maths package. No idea what it does. If you know, please fill it
in here and say whether it's any good.</P>

<P><B>AMB's home-grown matrix class library</B></P>

<P><TT>lib/libmatrix.a, include/{NagMatrix.h, NagVector.h}</TT></P>

<P>Home-grown C++ matrix and vector classes, written by Adam Baumberg.
Used by his image classes, but also useable in their own right.</P>

<p><b>AJH's home-grown matrix class library</b>

<p>
<tt>lib/libajhmatrix.a, include/{ajhmatrix.h}</tt>

<p>Tony Heap's matrix class. For example code see <tt>/src/ajhmatrix</tt>.

<H4>AMB's home-grown image class library</H4>

<P><TT>lib/libis.a, include/image_class/*.h</TT></P>

<P>Home-grown image classes, written by Adam Baumberg. Handle all aspects
of image manipulation, including capture from Indycam/external camera/MPEG
stream, processing (thresholding, filters, differencing etc) and output
to screen. Copes with full colour, black and white, YUV - you name it,
it does it. All that's needed is some documentation and a few sample programs
that new users could take and easily hack about with.</P>

<H3>Report Writing Utilities</H3>

<P>Well, there aren't any yet. We wondered whether letter/report templates
would be useful. What we do have is a nice <A HREF="/home/dream1_a/staff/vislib/WWW/img/vglogo.eps.gz">gzipped
eps of the Vision Group Logo</A>.</P>

<H3>Demos</H3>

<H4>Handtracker Demo</H4>

<P>Tony Heap's hand tracker software for tracking hands in 2D and 3D. Look
at the README files for more info, or look at the Hand Tracker <A HREF="http://dream1.leeds.ac.uk/~ajh/tracker.html">Web
site</A>.</P>

<H4>Pedestrian Behaviour Demos</H4>

<P>Neil Johnson's demos of pedestrian typicality assessment and pedestrian
trajectory prediction. See the README file for more info.</P>

<H3>Data</H3>

<P>Have a look and find out for yourself! At the moment there are a few
old movies of cars, and some MR images of hands.</P>

<H2>Maintenance</H2>

<P>VISLIB can and should be maintained by all members of the Vision Group.
If things are out of date, feel free to update them. If you're going to
delete anything, mail the group first to check no-one uses it. If you move
things around or update them or fix them, mail the group afterwards to
let them know you've done it.</P>

<H2>Adding new stuff</H2>

<P>VISLIB is supposed to provide resources which could be of general use
to the group, so if you've used something which you think other people
would benefit from, such as an interface builder or some nice C++ class
for handling 3D images or whatever, put it in here. Also, if you have any
good demos of your work they can go in the demos directory, or you could
alternatvely put them on your homepage.</P>

<P>In order to keep some form of order, try to observe the following guidelines:</P>

<UL>
<LI>If you're downloading something to try it out, you can put it initially
in the tmp directory. If it turns out to be naff, delete it.</LI>

<LI>When you install it proper, refer to the use of directories described
above to make sure you put it in the right place.</LI>

<LI><TT>gzip</TT> large data files, and <TT>strip</TT> and <TT>gzexe</TT>
large executables to save space.</LI>

<LI>Make sure any required symbolic links from the <TT>bin</TT>, <TT>lib</TT>
and <TT>include</TT> directories are set up. If executables have particularly
common names it might be an idea to give them a prefix to put them in context,
eg. all the MRI utils in <TT>bin</TT> are prefixed with <TT>mr_</TT>, so
<TT>flip</TT> has become <TT>mr_flip</TT>, which is more helpful.</LI>

<LI>Put a README or CONTENTS file in every directory you create, saying
what it it and who installed it (ie. you).</LI>

<LI>Put a short description of it in the Contents section above. If you
downloaded it, include any links to wherever you got it from. If it's homegrown,
and you're feeling energetic, write a Web page describing it.</LI>

<LI>Mail the group members to tell everyone about the great new thing you've
installed!</LI>
</UL>

<P>If disk space is running short you can apply to get some more. This
is best done through official channels (go through David or Roger).</P>

<P>Any major changes to the structure of the user space should probably
be discussed with everyone else first.</P>
