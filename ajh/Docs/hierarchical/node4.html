<P>
An anglepoise lamp consists of a fixed base and three rigid jointed
sections. This was modelled in 2D using 49
landmarks. Training examples were generated by choosing
uniformly-distributed random values
for the three pivot angles.
A global (linear) PCA was
performed.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#linearlamp">4</A>
shows the three most significant modes of variation. As can be seen,
even along the principal axes, there are several invalid shapes
generated.

A hierarchical PDM was then constructed from the same training data. 
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#lampclusters">5</A> shows the training set with the
locally-linear constraint patches
superimposed, giving some idea of the VSR that has been learned.
The concept of a mode of variation does not exist within the context of
a HPDM;
the nearest equivalent is to `drag' the model
through shape space, whilst applying shape constraints.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#constrainedlamp">6</A>
illustrates three such drags.
The results are much improved over the
linear PDM; points are seen to move along arcs, not straight lines,
and for the most part the lamp head size remains constant.

<P><H3><A NAME="SECTION00041100000000000000">Specificity</A></H3>
<P>
To measure the degree of model specificity (ability to exclude invalid shapes),
a large number of shapes
were generated, distributed randomly in the
shape space. The HPDM constraints were applied, and the distance (in
shape space) to the nearest position in the `ground-truth' VSR was
found (approximated as the distance to
the nearest of a large number of valid shapes)
We have defined the specificity error of the model to be the 90th
percentile of these
distances (this reflects maximum error whilst excluding outliers).
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#specificitygraphs">7</A> shows the effect on the specificity
error of the lamp's HPDM
as the number of clusters is varied. The degree of overlap is fixed for each
plot, so as the number of clusters increases, the cluster size
decreases accordingly. A lower bound to specificity error is
experienced due to our approximation of the `ground-truth' VSR; this
is the average distance between nearest-neighbour pairs in the ground
truth shape set, and is shown as `test accuracy'
on the graph. Plots for the linear PDM and Bregler's hyperplane
approach are also shown for comparison.

<P>
<P>
As expected, the model specificity error decreases as the number of
clusters increases, since the VSR is being approximated more and more
accurately
with an increasing number of linear patches. The graph levels out at
around <I>k</I> = 20, at which point the HPDM's specificity error is
roughly a quarter of that of the linear PDM. The improvement in
specificity achieved by using hyperellipsoid-bounded regions as opposed to
hyperplane constraints is also visible, as is the
degradation in specificity caused by increasing the degree of
overlap--this is because larger linear patches are covering
increasingly non-linear subregions of the VSR.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000">Automatically collected real data</A></H2>
<P>
The main motivation for this work was the desire to build models
from automatically collected training data. Hand shapes were sampled
directly from a live video stream. Various gestures were performed
against a black background; the image was thresholded and the hand
outline extracted using a simple boundary-finding algorithm. 100
landmarks were positioned at equal intervals around the boundary.
This method of data collection suffers
greatly from the problem that landmarks rarely mark the same
object feature across training examples.
For example, when the fingers are outstretched the boundary is much
longer than for a pointing gesture; the landmarks spread out more and
tend to `slide' round the boundary.
There were 1079 training examples in all;
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#handfreeegs">8</A> shows some examples.

A HPDM was constructed from the training data, using 80 clusters.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#freehandclusters">9</A> shows several views of the training
data in the global PCA shape space, along with the clusters found,
and Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#freehandvars">10</A> shows the four major
non-constrained modes of variation (top row) and the four equivalent
`drags' for the HPDM (bottom row).

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#freehandclusters">9</A> clearly illustrates that the training
data is virtually one-dimensional in nature; representing
transitions between the various gestures, however the paths through
the shape space are highly non-linear, spiraling through many
dimensions.
<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#freehandvars">10</A> demonstrates how in this case a Linear PDM
fails to produce a model which would be specific enough for object
tracking or location. The HPDM `drags' include only valid object
shapes. There appear to be discontinuities in various drags; this is
expected because the VSR is not necessarily continuous parallel to any
one axis in the global PCA space.
