<P>
Models of shape are used widely in computer vision; image features can be
located, tracked or classified using <I>a priori</I> knowledge of object
shape.
Many objects are non-rigid, requiring a <I>
deformable</I> model in order to capture shape variability.
<P>
One such model is the Point Distribution Model (PDM)&nbsp;[<A HREF="node6.html#cootes95">3</A>].
An object is modelled in terms of landmark points positioned
on object features, and at regular intervals in between.
By identifying such points on a set of
training examples, a statistical approach (principal
component analysis, or PCA) can be used to
discover the mean object shape, and the major modes of shape
variation.
<P>
The standard PDM is based purely on linear statistics (the PCA assumes
a Gaussian distribution of the training examples in shape space).
For any particular mode of variation, the positions of landmark points
can vary only along straight lines; non-linear variation is
achieved by a combination of two or more modes.
This situation is not ideal, firstly because the most compact
representation of shape variability is not achieved, and secondly
because implausible shapes can occur, when invalid combinations of
deformations are used.
<P>
Attempts have been made to combat this problem. Sozou <em>et al</em>'s Polynomial
Regression PDM&nbsp;[<A HREF="node6.html#sozou94">9</A>] allows landmark points to move along
combinations of polynomial paths. Heap and Hogg's
Cartesian-Polar Hybrid PDM&nbsp;[<A HREF="node6.html#heap95b">6</A>] makes use of polar coordinates
to model bending deformations more accurately.
Sozou <em>et al</em>&nbsp;[<A HREF="node6.html#sozou95">10</A>] have also
investigated using a multi-layer perceptron to provide a non-linear
mapping from shape parameters to shape.
<P>
All these approaches give some improvement over the linear PDM, but
they have their limitations. The first two can only model certain
types of non-linear deformation (polynomial and rotational
respectively). The perceptron method can model more
general non-linear deformations in one dimension, but performance
is poor
in cases where there is more than one degree of deformational
freedom.
<P>
The common feature of previous approaches is some form of
`linearising' mapping of
the shape space onto another uniform space.
In some cases such a mapping cannot exist;
for example when the distribution of valid shapes forms a region which
is hollow, has changing dimensionality, or is discontinuous.
<P>
Bregler and Omohundro&nbsp;[<A HREF="node6.html#bregler94">2</A>] describe a method for
approximating an arbitrary <em>surface</em> within an <I>n</I>-dimensional
space, using samples taken from it.
The training examples are divided into
(overlapping) clusters, and a PCA is performed separately
on each cluster.
This produces a set of locally-linear `patches',
the union of which gives the required approximation
to the surface.
<P>
This technique applies directly to object shape modelling. If the
training samples are examples of valid object shapes then the surface
produced is the region of valid shapes. Bregler models the shape of lips
in this way.
<P>
The piecewise-linear approach has also been touched on
by Ahmad <em>et al</em>&nbsp;[<A HREF="node6.html#ahmad95">1</A>].
They built a multi-gesture hand
model consisting of 5 sub-PCAs (one for each gesture) using a weighted
combination of the training examples, and experienced promising
results in terms of tracking performance.
Automation of the model building process was not considered;
both the collection of training data and the determination of cluster
membership were undertaken manually.
<P>
In this paper we extend the ideas of Bregler and Omohundro.
We describe alternative 
treatments of the locally-linear patches and union operations,
and highlight some of the design choices which must be made.
We also show how it is possible to use a
two-level hierarchical approach to improve efficiency and reduce
noise.
<P>
We apply the technique to synthetic data
containing non-linear deformation (an anglepoise lamp), and on
automatically-collected real data (hand shapes).
