<P>
We have described the construction of `hierarchical' PDMs, using a
piecewise linear PCA strategy. We have performed both qualitative and
quantitative analyses on synthetic data, and also examined performance
on automatically-collected real data, with promising results. The HPDM
is a viable solution to the problem of fully-automated construction of
deformable models.
<P>
The hierarchical approach requires a
large amount of training data to build good
models. However, this problem is negated by the fact that training
data can be collected automatically. In the example of the hand we gave,
it took less than 5 minutes to collect all the training data and build
the model. More intelligent training data
collection (eg. Hill and Taylor's approach&nbsp;[<A HREF="node6.html#hill96">7</A>])
might give rise to a less complex shape space which could then be modelled
with fewer linear pieces.
<P>
Another issue is that of speed. When applying the shape constraints it
is necessary to calculate distances to every cluster. This process is
order <I>n</I> in the number of clusters. Bregler and Omohundro suggest the
use of `Bumptrees'&nbsp;[<A HREF="node6.html#omohundro91">8</A>] (a tree-like data structure for
representing functions and constraints) to decrease the number of
calculations. A related approach would be to extend the hierarchical
model to more than two levels, inserting intermediate-sized PCA spaces
between the coarsest (global) and finest levels to give a multi-level
tree structure. Search for the nearest cluster(s) would descend
through the tree, giving at worst order <I>n</I> log <I>n</I> performance and
maybe better in the case of only a partial tree descent.
<P>
Tracking using HPDMs has proven relatively successful, proceeding in
much the same way as for a standard PDM&nbsp;[<A HREF="node6.html#cootes95">3</A>]; HPDMs are
less likely to be distracted by image noise and background
clutter. However, in the case of automatically trained models, some
deformations are not tracked well, specifically those which require
landmarks to `slide' around the model boundary or those which give
rise to sudden shape changes. A solution to this problem is discussed
in&nbsp;[<A HREF="node6.html#heap97a">5</A>].
