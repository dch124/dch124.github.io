<h2>Introduction</h2>

This tutorial gives a brief but hopefully enlightening introduction to
the Internet. We discuss what it actually is, where it came from and,
most importantly, what you can do with it. At the end there are a
number of useful and interesting Web sites for you to browse through,
and a quiz to test your browsing skills.

<h2>What is the Internet?</h2>

The internet is a computer's equivalent to the telephone system. It
comprises two basic parts:

<p>
<li> Lots of computers

<li> Lots of wires connecting them together.

<p>
Like the telephone system there are also lots of exchanges; computers
dedicated to routing messages to the right computer; these are largely
invisible to the computer users.

<p>
The main point about the Internet is that it's <i>very</i>
messy. There are wires <i>everywhere</i>, built by different people at
different times, and they're all connected together in lots of
different places.

<p>
The Internet provides a way for computers all over the world to `talk'
to each other. Of course, computers talk a different language to
humans - they talk in numbers, but it's still talking. The important
thing is that they all talk the same language. Most computers talk a
language called TCP-IP these days; those that don't need to have a
translator!

<p>
In some ways, the Internet is like the postal system, because messages
are sent in <i>packets</i>. Each packet must have the address of the
receiving computer, the address of the sending computer (so the
receiving computer knows who to reply to), and then the message being
sent. Like the postal system, packets can get delayed at busy times,
and even lost!

<p>
And in other ways, the Internet is like the road
system. Computers are interconnected in many different ways, with some
major trunk routes which take heavy traffic, and some windy country
lanes which serve only a few people. Some areas are well-planned out,
like Milton Keynes, and some are a bit of a nightmare (I'm thinking of
the M25); however, to my knowledge, there are no one-way roads in the
Internet. The point is that if there are `roadworks' on one route, or
if a town is closed all day for a street carnival,
messages can easily be re-routed another way, although there is likely
to be a short delay. There's no AA on the Internet though, so let's
hope your computer messages never need towing away.

<p>
In a short while, we'll discover just what computers talk about, but
first let's have a quick look at how the Internet was born.

<p>

<h2>Where did the Internet come from?</h2>

This is a very short history lesson; it's interesting because in order
to understand how the Internet ended up as it did today, you need to
look at when it was born and how it grew.

<p>
It all started in America. In the sixties, the US Government were very
worried about being blown to smithereens by nuclear attack from the
Russians. In those days there were only a few, very big, computers
(they used to fill whole rooms), and a well-placed strike could wipe
out the whole US military strategy computer system. They decided to
build a `decentralized' computer system - several slightly smaller
computers all connected together, so that if any one machine was
trashed, the others would still be OK and the system as a whole would
still function. It also meant that they could play Network DOOM!

<p>
And that's how it started. More and more computers were connected to
this initial network (called ARPANET) and things grew. Initially, only
the military had access, but later anyone was allowed to connect on at
any point. Other networks were developing at the same time in other
countries and when these joined on, the size of what was by then know
as the Internet shot up. The bigger the Internet gets, the faster it
grows. In 1969 there were four computers connected. Twenty years
later, in 1989, there were 160,000. Last July there were 6.5 million
and in the last six months this figure has increased to 9.5
million. At this rate, every man, woman and child in the world will
have their own personal connection in about 10 years time!

<h2>What does the Internet do?</h2>

The Internet itself doesn't really <i>do</i> anything exciting in
itself; it just transmits sequences of numbers from computer to
computer across the world. It's what <i>you do with it</i> that counts.

<p>
Here's a list of the main things people do with the Internet:

<p>
<li>Personal communication

<p>
<i>E-mail</i> is an electronic version of the postal service. Type a
message on your screen, enter the address of a friend, hit the `send'
button and away it goes. The message is zapped across the world to its
destination and placed in the recipient's electronic mailbox. Unlike
the postal service (known as snail-mail to computer users), e-mails
arrive in minutes, if not seconds. Luckily, junk e-mail has not yet
hit the Internet.

<p>
When a more interactive form of communication is needed,
you can hold an interactive `talk' session with someone. The
screen splits in two. What you type appears in the top
half and what the other person types appears in the bottom half. It's
not as easy as using a telephone, but it's certainly a lot cheaper.

<p>
<li>Remote working

<p>
This was the original intended use of the
Internet. So long as you have a suitable password, you can `log in' to
any machine on the Internet and use all its facilities. You might want
to use a Cray MkII supercomputer to do some number crunching for you,
or you may be working as part of a team spread all over the country
(or world). Many people in the computer industry now work from home in
this way.

<p>
<li>Newsgroups (USENET)

<p>
Unbeknown to the general public, (USENET) is a collection of
over 3000 discussion groups (newsgroups) where people worldwide
exchange information, hold debates and generally gossip. Each
newsgroup is dedicated to a particular topic, with names like
com.amiga.games or rec.music.blur. Anyone can `post' a message
on any newsgroup, airing their opinion on a subject or offering an
answer to a question asked in an earlier posting. And everyone who reads
that newsgroup will read what you write.

<p>
One of the biggest problems with newsgroups is `flaming' - people's
opinions differ and when controversial viewpoints are posted, they
inevitably start a flame war; this is essentially a slanging match
between two or more people which gets very tedious for everyone else,
but can sometimes be great fun to watch!

<p>
<li>Getting information

<p>
This is fast becoming the predominant use of the Internet, and it's in
this context that the Internet is referred to as the World Wide Web
(or Cyberspace, or the Information Superhighway); people have
gone Web-crazy; downloading text, pictures, computer programs and now
even virtual reality scenes from all over the world.

<p>
It works like this. Everyone who is
connected to the Internet sets aside an area of their system
for outside access. In this area they place information (in computer
files) that
they want to be available on the Web. To access all this stuff all you
need is a <i>browser</i> on your own machine, and a list of useful
addresses. You type the address into your browser; it sends a message
to the remote machine, requesting the file to be sent to
you. Depending on the type of file, you can then read it, look at it,
play it (it might be a game) or whatever.

<p>
Most files these days are
HTML files; this is what you view when you use Mosaic or
Netscape. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language; the important
bit is the `hypertext'. Hypertext is like normal text
except that it usually looks more exciting (with nice fonts, icons
and graphics) and, more importantly, it contains <i>links</i> to other
related hypertexts. When you read one Web `page' there are usually at
least ten links to follow. These might point to Web pages at
different sites, in other countries even.

<p>
And because everyone everywhere is adding new Web pages every minute
of every day, the amount of stuff out there is immense, and it keeps
growing and growing. Any topic, any subject - news, share prices, the
weather forecast, music, sports and so on and so on - you name it,
somebody's written it.
It's all too easy to spend hours and hours
just `surfing' the Web, following links to new places, following more
links and so on. The number of times you think, "I'll just follow one
more, and then I'm stopping..."

<h2>A World Wide Web Quiz</h2>

Here's where you get to test your Web-browsing skills. Below is a list
of questions, the answers to which can be found somewhere on the
Web. You'll find some links to useful Web pages in the `links' section
of the Summer School Web page. For some of the answers you may need to
use a <i>search engine</i>; ask the helpers for more details.

<p>
To attempt the quiz, open another browser window so you don't have to
keep returning here and then go surfing for the answers.
Fill them in as you find them on the form below,
then when you have them all, fill in your name and hit the `submit'
button to send the answers to us.
